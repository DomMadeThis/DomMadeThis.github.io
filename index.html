        <h2>Highlighted projects</h2>
        <p>College freshmen struggle with the change, they used to wake up when their 
          parents told them to. This can lead to missed deadlines and a long struggle
           to catch up to missing work. I aim to design a website that can help students
            keep better track of their deadlines and helps them better navigate through 
            their college life without stressing about when they need to find time.</p>
